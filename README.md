# Stock_Market_Analysis
An exploratory Data Analysis on the tech stocks like Apple, Google, Amazon and Tesla. Predicting the future stock price and risk analysis with monte - carlo simulation (GBM).


In this project, we'll analyse data from the stock market for some technology stocks.

Again, we'll use Pandas, seaborn to extract and analyse the information, visualise it, and look at different ways to analyse the risk of a stock, based on its performance history.

Here are the questions we'll try to answer:

What was the change in a stock's price over time?

What was the daily return average of a stock?

What was the moving average of various stocks? List item

What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?

How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

How can we attempt to predict future stock behaviour?
